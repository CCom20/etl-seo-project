My studies were demanding, but they prepared me to be able to handle the high-stress environment I encounter in my work. The research and critical thinking skills I developed during my undergraduate studies have been invaluable when I am preparing for a position in a new country. The opportunity I had to study abroad in Oxford through CCU led me down the path of wanting to live overseas while still serving my country.Josh Millard ’01As an Exhibit Specialist, I’m regularly called upon to assist other curatorial staff in how we as a museum present our nation’s history. It is a very hands-on and tangible method of historical interpretation. Without a good understanding of our past and historical context it would be impossible to do my job. At CCU I received not just historical knowledge, but learned how to interpret people and events from the past. It prepared me well for a job where I’m helping present historical information to the general public.\\xa0',\n",

The practice of the therapeutic musician is to use the intrinsic healing elements of live music and sound to provide an environment conducive to the human healing process. The practice of a therapeutic musician is not to be confused with the practice of a music therapist.Playing for patients and staff on-on-one by the bedside is a worthy calling and ministry for those whom God calls to use their music gifts in this way. Research has demonstrated that live therapeutic music truly makes a positive difference in the healing process.Opportunities for Music Therapy PreparationFor those interested in becoming a certified music therapist, all courses necessary for application to the graduate program in Music Therapy at Colorado State University are available to undergraduate students at CCU.Students who desire to enter the CSU equivalency program will need to have a good foundation on piano, guitar, and voice and at least two semesters of music theory and one classical music history course.

Students explore human nature and ethics along with political and economic power and history. They are led to grapple with the meaning and significance of the American founding, with the relation of virtue and liberty to the rule of law and human happiness, with America’s role in the world, and with the current political landscape.There are many careers open to students of Politics, from law school or graduate school, to work in state and local government, to jobs as diplomats, intelligence analysts, or Capitol Hill staffers in Washington, to work in NGO’s and social enterprises. The key is to use college as a time to explore and confirm how exactly God may be calling you to serve your community and your country.The Politics programs at CCU also offer you several internship opportunities, including at the Colorado General Assembly. The annual Washington Week seminar provides you an opportunity to meet with government officials, policy analysts, and members of the news media.

This provides graduates with the concepts and methods for analyzing the role and impact of political players and institutions across the world, while integrating theological principles within the context of current political affairs and good citizenship.CCU Politics AlumniTony Black ’14Tony Black went on to complete his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School.

       "  'page_paras': \"Undergraduate Minor in Young Life LeadershipYoung Life is a Christian ministry that reaches out to middle school and high school kids in all 50 of the United States as well as more than 90 countries around the world. Young Life doesn't start with a program. It starts with young adults who are concerned enough about kids to go to them, on their turf and in their culture, building bridges of authentic friendship. Kids' lives are dramatically influenced when caring people come alongside them, sharing God's love with them. These relationships don't happen overnight — they take time, patience, trust, and consistency.Course CatalogYoung Life Leadership MinorYoung Life Leadership at CCUStudents in the Young Life Leadership minor at Colorado Christian University take courses in discipleship, cross-cultural ministry, and ministry leadership.

Upon graduation, you'll also be prepared for seminary or graduate school.Request InfoCourse CatalogYouth Ministry MajorYouth Ministry MinorYouth Ministry at CCUIt’s a whole new ball game. Youth culture has changed — even from just 10 years ago. With the rise of postmodernism and new expectations being placed on youth pastors and workers, there has never been a more important time for serious training, and that’s what you'll find at CCU. CCU's youth ministry degree program began over 30 years ago. In fact, you might call us one of the pioneers of youth ministry. Since that time, many other schools looking to train youth workers have modeled their programs after CCU's. We're established, but not stagnant. Our curriculum is continually updated — emphasizing biblical principles, discipleship, counseling relationships, and effective communication. In addition to classroom learning and internships, opportunities exist every year to participate in local and national ministry training events through CCU's involvement in the Youth Specialties Academic Support Network.What can you do with a degree in youth ministry?Youth workerYouth pastorNonprofit workMinistry administrationDomestic or international ministrySchool of TheologyMeet the FacultyYoung people need models, not critics.\\xa0– John Wooden, American basketball player and coach (1910–2010)Click here to expand text\",\n",
